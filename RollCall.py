# FINAL NOTES
# THINGS I COULDN'T FIX YET:

# In the Rapid Fire mode,
# 1. I haven't worked out yet how to make a "user entered a false entry" and prompt the user to enter
# again, instead of starting to entire loop again. That's why I created a class.
# 2. I haven't worked out yet how to skip the first entry when iterating through the CSV file, and how to index when
# iterating through a not callable object in general

# In the Search mode,
# 1. I haven't yet worked out how to return an error saying "the name user entered is not in database", and prompt
# the user to try again
